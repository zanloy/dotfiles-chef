# oh_my_zsh
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lxmx/chef-oh-my-zsh.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lxmx/chef-oh-my-zsh)

## Description

This cookbook features:

* A Chef LWRP to install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for system users.
* A companion recipe for [user::data_bag](https://github.com/fnichol/chef-user) which adds an oh-my-zsh per user installation option.

## Usage

Include `recipe[oh_my_zsh]` in your `run_list` and `oh_my_zsh_user` resource will become available.

The `oh_my_zsh::data_bag` recipe assumes that you're using the `user::data_bag` recipe from the excellent [user cookbook](https://github.com/fnichol/chef-user). It lets you configure oh-my-zsh installation in user specific data_bags, e.g.

```
{
  "id"        : "testman",
  "home"      : "/home/testman"
  ...
  "oh-my-zsh" : { "enabled": true, "theme": "wedisagree", "plugins": ["git", "rvm"] }
}
```

## Recipes

### default

No-op, does nothing.

### data_bag

  ...
  "oh-my-zsh" : { "enabled": true }
}
```

#### .zshrc.chef.local / .zshrc.local customziation made easy

**.zshrc.chef.local**

Enables you to deploy additional zsh configuration per user, extending central aliases or whatever you like.
So this file should still be under control of your chef cookbook, but rather optionally include wrapper cookbook extensions of any kind.

This file is loaded per user in the end of the .zshrc file

**.zshrc.local** 

This file can be created by the user, if he decides to - this file is not controlled by chef - its for the local user to put his little aliases inside. 

#### Example

```ruby
oh_my_zsh_user 'jessie' do
  plugins        %w{git ruby}
  autocorrect    false
  case_sensitive true
end
```

## Tests

You can run the test using kitchen
